# Has-Sci

A collection of computational methods in science.

The aim of this libary is to utilise the powerful type system of haskell and its awesome expressivity to keep the underlying mathematics visible, while making extensive use of typeclasses to allow easy plugging of external objects, methods and numerical libraries.
